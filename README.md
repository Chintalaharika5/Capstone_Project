# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Histopathological Images

This capstone project focuses on predicting breast cancer using histopathological images from the BreakHis dataset. The project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify breast cancer images effectively.

## Main Features
- **Model Implementation and Comparison**: 
   - Developed and compared the performance of CNN, RF, and SVM models for breast cancer prediction.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: 
   - Explored the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on improving model performance.
- **Comprehensive Metrics Analysis**: 
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to provide detailed performance insights.

## Technology Stack
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.
- **Python**: Programming language for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**:
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for deep learning-based image classification.
   - **Random Forest (RF)** for ensemble-based learning.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for high-dimensional classification.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
